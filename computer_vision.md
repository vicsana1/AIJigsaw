# How images are stored in computers
We can say without any discussion that images are omnipresent in computer systems. For instance, web browsers display thousands of images per day, you have many images stored in your smartphones, and your Youtube videos are no more than a sequence of images. In many computer systems, images are stored as a 3-dimensional matrix of number where each cell represents one pixel or point in the image and its values for the red, green, and blue channels.

So, an image is no more than just a collection of numbers in a computer. The computer does not know what those numbers represent and it just displays the image on the screen. Then, how come nowadays systems are capable of recognizing objects in images or even track them? This is all thanks to an artificial intelligence branch named as **computer vision**.

# Computer Vision
Computer vision is the discipline that **provide computers with the ability to understand and interpret images** (or videos).The long term goals is providing computers with a human-like capability (or even better) to analyze images and extract information from them. 

The list of typical tasks that a computer vision system undergoes is:
- **Acquire**: This means extracting images from multiple sources such as the web, a camera, a sensor, and so forth. In other terms, transforming a physical view into a digital image.
- **Preprocess**: In many cases, images tend to be affected by effects like noise, low contrast, blurriness, or color defects that may become obstacles for the interpretation of those images. In order to avoid these problems, many times images acquired are preprocessed by using filters and other mechanisms.
- **Analyzing**: Once images have been preprocessed, they are ready to be analyzed in order to find patterns or structures that help the computer to interpret the information that is contained in them. For this, a variety of methods coming from mathematics, geometry or the domain of application can be employed.
- **Understanding**: Finally, based on patterns observed the computer has to interpret the information contained in the image based on previous experiences, internal knowledge, and any other method.

Applications for computer vision span any system where computers have to analyze and interpret information in images. For instance, those include but are not limited to:
- Face recognition
- Tracking in surveillance applications
- Image filters
- Face detection
- Analysis of medical images
- Navigation of robots
- Detecting actions in videos
- Movement detection (i.e., XBOX Kinect)
- Intruder detection
- etc.
