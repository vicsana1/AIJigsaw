# A Jigsaw activity for Artificial Intelligence Techniques
This is research material that lecturers can employ for teaching 1st year undergraduate students on different types of artificial intelligence techniques. The materials are meant to be used in a Jigsaw activity, although they could potentially be used in other activities too.

These materials assume no technical knowledge on the field and they normally consist of a brief motivation for the need of those techniques, and then a brief explanation on what these techniques are for and how they work. By the end, the students can also find 2 to 3 videos that they can watch to further understand the topics and kick off their research in the classroom.

## Topics:
This is the list of topics included so far in the activity. More will be included in the future as the activity evolves.
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- [Computer Vision](http://vicsana1.github.io/AIJigsaw/computer_vision)
- [Recommender Systems](http://vicsana1.github.io/AIJigsaw/recommender_systems)
- [Genetic Algorithms](http://vicsana1.github.io/AIJigsaw/genetic_algorithms)

## Jigsaw Activity (Suggested organization)
- Dividing students into groups of at least 5 students (5 minutes)
- Letting students decide who will take each topic in the group (1 minute)
- Students start their research by using the provided resources (20 minutes)
- Students discuss on their findings within their groups (10 minutes)
- Teams play a quizzing game (10 minutes)
