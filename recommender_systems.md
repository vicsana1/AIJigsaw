# The filtering problem in E-Commerce
Nowadays, many of us browse the Internet looking for products such as videogames, movies, clothes, computers, cars, or even the next episode or video to watch. The increase in the number of customers browsing the Internet, has came hand in hand with the increase in the number of e-commerce sites and the products that they offer. This means, that nowadays we have millions of products available to purchase. In fact, just a single provider like Amazon can offer millions of these.

As customers, we may feel overwhelmed by all the possibilities available as there is too much browse and we have a very limited and valuable time. If customers are not helped to find the products that they want, they will likely leave our e-commerce sites without making any purchase. The worse nightmare for any e-commerce business. So, the question that arises is how can we show relevant products to customers?

# Solution: Recommender Systems
Recommender Systems were created with the goal of **matching customers to relevant products**. The output of a recommendation system is a a prediction of how much you will like a particular product. Therefore, showing relevant products to customers should heep their engagement and increase the chances of customers purchasing products. The sweet dream of every e-commerce site!

Many recommendation systems produce recommendations by looking at your behaviour (e.g., previous purchases, ratings, navigation) and the behaviour of other users in the system. The general idea is that of using your past preferences to predict what you would like to consume now. There are three main families of recommender systems:
- **Content-based recommender systems**: They produce recommendations of new products based on the products that you liked in the past and the descriptions of the products available. The idea is that, **the more similar a product is to products that you liked in the past, the more likely it is that you will like that product**. For instance, in the image below a content-based recommender system would predict that you would like *La La Land* because it is a romance, drama, and musical, and you have liked those types of movies in the past (i.e., *Grease* and *Moulin Rouge*).<img src="https://github.com/vicsana1/AIJigsaw/raw/master/content-based.png"/>
- **Collaborative filtering systems**: These recommendations are **based on the products that you liked in the past, and the products that other users liked in the system**. For instance, I can recommend items based on the similarity between users. in the figure below, the second and third user have provided similar ratings to us in the past. Therefore, I can assume that my taste with respect to *The Sixth Sense* will be similar to theirs.<img src="https://github.com/vicsana1/AIJigsaw/raw/master/collaborative.png"/>
- **Hybrid approaches**: They **combine recommendations** that have been produced by both collaborative and content-based recommender systems.

In today's world, recommender systems have become the norm to the point that no one can think of an e-commerce site without any kind of recommendation algorithm.
